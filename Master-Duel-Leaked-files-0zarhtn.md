Master Duel has been open about her struggles with depression and anxiety, but her online presence has also attracted toxicity and online harassment. Critics argue that her content perpetuates harmful stereotypes and objectifies women. Some fans, meanwhile, defend her right to express herself and criticize the double standards surrounding female sexuality. Born in 1995, Master Duel grew up in a musical family and began singing at a young age. She was heavily influenced by artists such as Adele, Florence + The Machine, and Lorde, and began writing her own songs as a teenager. After completing her education, Master Duel released her debut single "Lost in the Moment" in 2017, which quickly gained traction online and caught the attention of music industry professionals.
